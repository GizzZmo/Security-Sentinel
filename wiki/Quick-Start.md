======================

Welcome! I'm your AI security expert powered by Google Gemini. 
Ask me anything about your system's security, threat analysis, 
or cybersecurity best practices.

You: What should I check first on a new Windows 11 system?

AI Assistant: Great question! For a new Windows 11 system, I recommend 
checking these security essentials first:

1. **Windows Updates**: Ensure all security patches are installed
2. **Windows Defender**: Verify real-time protection is enabled
3. **Firewall Settings**: Check that Windows Firewall is active
4. **User Account Control**: Ensure UAC is set to appropriate level
5. **Network Security**: Review active connections and services

Would you like me to help you check any of these specific areas?

You: _
```

#### Web Interface - AI Assistant Tab

- Contextual security recommendations
- Real-time streaming responses
- Security-focused knowledge base

## üîç Essential First Checks

### 1. Verify System Status

Check that monitoring is working:

**Signs of Proper Operation:**
- ‚úÖ CPU and memory readings update regularly
- ‚úÖ Network connections are detected
- ‚úÖ Threat level indicator is active
- ‚úÖ AI assistant responds to queries

### 2. Test Security Features

Try these quick tests:

1. **Network Detection Test:**
   - Open a web browser
   - Navigate to a website
   - Verify new connections appear in Network Monitor

2. **AI Response Test:**
   - Ask: "What security tools are built into Windows 11?"
   - Verify you get a detailed, relevant response

3. **System Monitoring Test:**
   - Run a resource-intensive application
   - Watch CPU/memory usage change in real-time

### 3. Configure Basic Settings

Customize for your environment:

#### C++ Application (`config.ini`):
```ini
[monitoring]
enabled=true
update_interval=5          # Update every 5 seconds
log_level=INFO            # Adjust verbosity

[network]
monitor_enabled=true
block_suspicious=true
whitelist_ips=192.168.1.0/24  # Trust your local network

[ai]
max_tokens=1000           # Limit response length
temperature=0.7           # Balance accuracy vs creativity
```

#### Web Interface:

### Next Steps

Now that you're up and running, explore these guides:

1. **[Dashboard Overview](Dashboard-Overview.md)** - Understand all interface elements
2. **[Network Monitoring](Network-Monitoring.md)** - Deep dive into network analysis
3. **[Threat Protection](Threat-Protection.md)** - Configure advanced protection
4. **[AI Assistant](AI-Assistant.md)** - Maximize AI capabilities
5. **[Configuration](Configuration.md)** - Advanced settings and customization

### Common First-Time Questions

**Q: Why do I need administrator privileges?**
A: Administrator rights allow Security Sentinel to access Windows APIs for process monitoring, network analysis, and system-level security features.

**Q: How much network data does the AI use?**
A: Only security-related queries are sent to the AI. Your monitoring data stays local unless you specifically ask the AI to analyze something.

**Q: Can I run both versions simultaneously?**
A: Yes! The C++ application and web interface can run together, providing different views of the same system.

**Q: What if I don't have a Gemini API key?**
A: The core monitoring features work without an API key. You'll only miss the AI assistant functionality.

## üõ†Ô∏è Quick Troubleshooting

### Application Won't Start

1. **Check administrator privileges:**
   ```bash
   # Right-click SecuritySentinel.exe
   # Select "Run as administrator"
   ```

2. **Verify API key format:**
   ```ini
   # config.ini - no quotes, no extra spaces
   [gemini]
   api_key=AIza...your_key_here
   ```

3. **Check Windows Defender:**
   - Add SecuritySentinel to exclusions
   - Temporarily disable real-time protection to test

### No Network Data

1. **Verify administrator mode:** Network monitoring requires elevated privileges
2. **Check Windows Firewall:** Ensure it's not blocking the application
3. **Test with browser:** Open a website to generate network activity

### AI Not Responding

1. **Verify API key:** Ensure it's correctly set in configuration
2. **Check internet connection:** AI requires online access
3. **Test API key:** Visit Google AI Studio to verify the key works

### Performance Issues

1. **Adjust update interval:** Increase from 5 seconds to 10 or 15
2. **Close other security tools:** Avoid conflicts with other monitoring software
3. **Check system resources:** Ensure adequate RAM and CPU available
