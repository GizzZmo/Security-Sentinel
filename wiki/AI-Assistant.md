# AI Assistant

Comprehensive guide to using the Gemini AI assistant for intelligent security analysis and guidance.

## ü§ñ Overview

Security Sentinel integrates Google's Gemini AI to provide intelligent security analysis, real-time threat assessment, and personalized security recommendations. The AI assistant helps analyze security events, interpret system behavior, and provide actionable guidance.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Configuring the AI Assistant

#### C++ Application
1. Open `config.ini` in your Security Sentinel directory
2. Add your Gemini API key:
```ini
[gemini]
api_key=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
model=gemini-2.5-flash
max_tokens=1000
temperature=0.7
```

#### Web Interface
1. Create or edit `.env.local` file
2. Add your API key:
```env
VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### Getting Your API Key
1. Visit [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Create a new API key
4. Copy the key to your configuration

## üí¨ Using the AI Assistant

### Interactive Chat Interface

The AI assistant provides contextual security guidance through a chat interface:

```
You: "What does this network activity indicate?"

AI Assistant: Based on the network connections you're showing, I can see:

1. **Normal Web Traffic**: Chrome connections to Google services (443/HTTPS)
2. **Email Sync**: Outlook connecting to Exchange servers (993/IMAPS)  
3. **Potential Concern**: Unknown process connecting to 192.168.1.200:8080

I recommend investigating that last connection. Here's how:
- Check what process is making the connection
- Verify if 192.168.1.200 is a trusted device on your network
- Consider temporarily blocking the IP if it's suspicious

Would you like me to help you analyze any specific connections?
```

### Common Use Cases
