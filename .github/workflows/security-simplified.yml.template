# Alternative: Simplified Security Workflow (For Default CodeQL Setup)
#
# If you prefer to use GitHub's default CodeQL setup instead of the advanced matrix configuration,
# you can replace the codeql-analysis job in security.yml with this simplified version.
#
# To use this:
# 1. Enable default CodeQL setup in Settings → Security → Code scanning
# 2. Replace the codeql-analysis job in security.yml with the content below
# 3. Remove the matrix strategy and custom build steps

# SIMPLIFIED CODEQL JOB (COPY TO security.yml IF NEEDED):
#
# codeql-analysis:
#   name: 🔍 CodeQL Analysis (Simplified)
#   runs-on: ubuntu-latest
#   permissions:
#     actions: read
#     contents: read
#     security-events: write
#   
#   steps:
#   - name: 📥 Checkout code
#     uses: actions/checkout@v4
#     
#   - name: 🔍 Initialize CodeQL
#     uses: github/codeql-action/init@v3
#     with:
#       languages: javascript  # Only JavaScript for simplified setup
#       
#   - name: 🔨 Auto-build
#     uses: github/codeql-action/autobuild@v3
#     
#   - name: 🔍 Perform CodeQL Analysis
#     uses: github/codeql-action/analyze@v3

# NOTE: This simplified version only covers JavaScript analysis.
# C++ analysis would be handled by the default setup if enabled in repository settings.
