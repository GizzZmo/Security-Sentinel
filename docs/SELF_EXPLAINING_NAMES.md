# Self-Explaining Names Implementation

This document describes the implementation of self-explaining names across all Security Sentinel applications to improve code clarity and maintainability.

## Problem Addressed

The original codebase used generic names like "Dashboard", "Monitor", "ViewManager" that didn't clearly indicate their security monitoring purpose. The naming was also inconsistent between different applications (C++, Go, React).

## Solution: Self-Explaining Security-Focused Names

### React TypeScript Application

#### Enums and Types
- **`SecurityView`** enum instead of generic `View`:
  - `SecurityDashboard` → "Security Dashboard"
  - `NetworkTrafficMonitor` → "Network Traffic Monitor" 
  - `ThreatDetectionCenter` → "Threat Detection Center"
  - `SecurityAIAssistant` → "Security AI Assistant"

- **`SecurityChatMessage`** interface for AI security interactions
- **`NetworkSecurityLog`** interface with security-focused fields:
  - `threatType` instead of `threat`
  - `securityStatus` instead of `status`

#### Components
- **`SecuritySentinelApp`** - Main application component
- **`SecurityNavigationSidebar`** - Navigation with security modules
- **`SecurityHeader`** - Security-focused header component
- **`SecurityDashboard`** - Security metrics overview
- **`NetworkTrafficMonitor`** - Real-time network security monitoring
- **`ThreatDetectionCenter`** - Advanced threat protection interface
- **`SecurityAIAssistant`** - AI-powered security analysis

### C++ Native Application

#### Classes
- **`SecuritySentinelApp`** - Main security application controller
- **`SecurityViewManager`** - Manages security monitoring views
- **`SecurityGeminiClient`** - AI client for security analysis
- **`SystemSecurityMonitor`** - System-level security monitoring

#### Methods
- `InitializeSecurity()` instead of `Initialize()`
- `ShowSecurityView()` instead of `ShowView()`
- `InitializeSecurityComponents()` instead of `InitializeComponents()`
- `HandleSecurityUserInput()` instead of `HandleUserInput()`

### Go Core Module

#### Types
- **`SecuritySentinelCore`** - Main security core structure
- **`SecurityCheckResult`** - Security analysis results with fields:
  - `SecurityCheckID` instead of `CheckID`
  - `SecurityStatus` instead of `Status` 
  - `ThreatSeverity` instead of `Severity`
  - `SecurityAnalysis` instead of `Description`
  - `ThreatDetails` instead of `Details`
  - `MitigationSteps` instead of `Remediation`

- **`SystemSecurityInfo`** - Security-focused system information:
  - `OperatingSystem`, `SystemArchitecture`
  - `SecurityHostname`, `SecurityCPUCount`

#### Functions
- **`InitializeSecurityCore()`** - Initialize security monitoring core
- **`GetSystemSecurityInfo()`** - Get security-relevant system info
- **`PerformSecurityFileIntegrityCheck()`** - File integrity security analysis
- **`PerformSecurityRegistryAnalysis()`** - Registry security analysis
- **`PerformSecurityDirectoryThreatAnalysis()`** - Directory threat analysis

## Benefits Achieved

### 1. **Clarity of Purpose**
- Every component/function name clearly indicates it's for security monitoring
- No ambiguity about what each module does

### 2. **Consistency Across Languages**
- Similar concepts use similar naming patterns in C++, Go, and TypeScript
- Security prefix consistently applied where appropriate

### 3. **Self-Documentation**
- Code is more readable without needing extensive comments
- New developers can understand the security focus immediately

### 4. **Maintainability**
- Easier to locate security-related functionality
- Reduces confusion between generic utilities and security components

## Implementation Notes

### Backward Compatibility
- Original interfaces are being phased out gradually
- New names maintain the same functionality with improved clarity

### Naming Conventions Used
- **C++**: `SecurityPascalCase` for classes, `securityCamelCase_` for members
- **Go**: `SecurityPascalCase` for exported types, `securityCamelCase` for functions
- **TypeScript**: `SecurityPascalCase` for interfaces/components, `securityCamelCase` for variables

### Future Extensions
This naming pattern can be extended to new security modules:
- `SecurityNetworkAnalyzer`
- `SecurityThreatIntelligence`
- `SecurityIncidentResponse`
- `SecurityComplianceMonitor`

## Code Examples

### React Component Usage
```typescript
const [currentView, setCurrentView] = useState<SecurityView>(
  SecurityView.SecurityDashboard
);

const securityMessages: SecurityChatMessage[] = [];
const networkLogs: NetworkSecurityLog[] = [];
```

### C++ Class Usage
```cpp
auto securityApp = std::make_unique<SecuritySentinelApp>();
securityApp->InitializeSecurity();
securityApp->ShowSecurityView("SecurityDashboard");
```

### Go Function Usage
```go
InitializeSecurityCore();
securityInfo := GetSystemSecurityInfo();
result := PerformSecurityFileIntegrityCheck("/etc/passwd");
```

This implementation ensures that all Security Sentinel components have self-explaining names that clearly indicate their purpose in the security monitoring ecosystem.
