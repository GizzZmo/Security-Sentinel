# Creating Release v1.1.0

This document explains how to create the release v1.1.0 for Security Sentinel.

## Steps to Create Release

### 1. Version Updates (Already Completed)
- ✅ Updated `CMakeLists.txt` version to 1.1.0
- ✅ Updated `package.json` version to 1.1.0  
- ✅ Updated `CHANGELOG.md` to move unreleased changes to v1.1.0
- ✅ Tested both C++ and web builds successfully

### 2. Create Git Tag
To create and push the release tag (requires push permissions):

```bash
git tag v1.1.0
git push origin v1.1.0
```

### 3. Alternative: Manual Release Trigger
Since the release workflow supports manual dispatch, you can trigger it manually:

1. Go to GitHub Actions: https://github.com/GizzZmo/Security-Sentinel-Linux-and-Windows-/actions
2. Select "Release" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow" 
4. Enter version: `v1.1.0`
5. Click "Run workflow" button

### 4. Verify Release
The workflow will automatically:
- Build Windows C++ executable using Visual Studio 2022
- Build web interface using Node.js 18
- Package both as release artifacts
- Create GitHub release with download links

## Build Verification

Both build systems were tested successfully:

### C++ Build (Linux test)
- **Executable Size**: 1.2MB (SecuritySentinel)
- **Build Tool**: CMake + Make
- **Status**: ✅ Built successfully

### Web Build 
- **Bundle Size**: ~773KB total (after gzip)
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Status**: ✅ Built successfully

## Release Artifacts Expected

The release will include:
1. `security-sentinel-windows-v1.1.0.zip` - Windows native executable
2. `security-sentinel-web-v1.1.0.tar.gz` - Web interface files

These will be automatically generated by the GitHub Actions release workflow.
